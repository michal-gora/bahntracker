"""
Model Train Synchronization Server

Connects to geops.io WebSocket API, tracks a real S3 train going toward
Mammendorf/Maisach, and drives the state machine that controls the model
train and station display.

Architecture:
    - ONE state machine on this server (train_state_machine.py)
    - Model train = dumb I/O (receives SPEED/STOP, sends HALL)
    - Station display = dumb I/O (receives STATION commands)

Usage:
    python sbahn.py
    Then type 'h' + Enter to simulate a HALL sensor trigger.
    Type 's' + Enter to see current status.
    Type 'q' + Enter to quit.
